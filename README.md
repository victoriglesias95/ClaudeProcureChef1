Key Technical Improvements

Data Access Layer Pattern: Services now separate data access from business logic for easier database migration
Type Safety: All components properly typed with TypeScript
Quote Validity System: Intelligent quote management reduces unnecessary supplier communications
Mock Data Enhancement: Realistic quote expiry dates and blanket quote support

Next Steps
Immediate Priorities

Quote detail views implementation
Bulk request selection for quotes
Supplier-specific product filtering

Future Enhancements

Database integration (Supabase)
PWA features for mobile access
Advanced reporting and analytics
Real-time notifications

Current Workflow

Inventory → Request: Select items, create request
Request → Quote: Approve request, generate quotes
Quote → Comparison: View validity, compare prices
Comparison → Order: Select suppliers, create orders
Dashboard: Monitor unordered requests

Technical Stack

React 18 with TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
React Router v6
Supabase (prepared, using mocks)
Custom UI components

Migration Notes
The app is ready for database integration with:

Separated data access layer
Consistent service patterns
Mock data structure matching planned DB schema
