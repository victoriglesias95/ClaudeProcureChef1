ProcureChef: Project Overview
Project Description
ProcureChef is a comprehensive procurement management system designed specifically for restaurants. It streamlines the entire purchasing workflow from inventory tracking to supplier management, helping restaurants optimize their procurement processes, reduce costs, and minimize waste.
Core Purpose
The application bridges the gap between kitchen staff, purchasing departments, and suppliers by providing a centralized platform for managing ingredient requests, quotes, and orders. ProcureChef aims to solve common restaurant procurement challenges including:

Inefficient manual ordering processes
Lack of visibility across departments
Difficulty comparing supplier quotes
Incomplete fulfillment of chef requests
Poor inventory management

Target Users

Design Philosophy
The application follows a clean, intuitive design inspired by modern food delivery apps while maintaining a sophisticated look with our Elegant Slate color palette (deep burgundy, slate gray, white/off-white, and subtle green accents). The interface prioritizes usability across both mobile and desktop devices, recognizing that kitchen staff often use mobile devices while purchasing departments typically work on desktops.
Business Value

Minimize food waste with improved inventory management

This project represents a complete end-to-end solution that transforms restaurant procurement from a fragmented, manual process into a streamlined, digital workflow.
